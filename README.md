PRODUCT 

Selecting Data/DataSet 
- We used data from Media Cloud. As advised by the Prof, we used a subset of the data, i.e. the tags of 'Center', 'Left', 'Center Left', 'Right' and 'Center Right' media. Within this, we queried for 5 things for 2019 (1) overall trend of these tags vs trend for "socialism" or "socialist" (2) "socialism" and "democrat" within 15 words of each other (3) "socialism"/"socialist" and Green New Deal (4) "socialism"/"socialist" and The Squad, or any of its members (5) "socialism"/"socialist" and "medicare for all". These are our base CSV files. From these CSV files we filtered out the redundant columns (such as the "All" column). 

Selecting Visualisation 
- For our MVP1 we ran a basic search and used a basic line graph that media cloud produced. For MVP2, we recreated this graph (and others) in datawrapper. We also used datawrapper to produce a stacked bar graph. For our D3JS visualisation, we pulled a grouped bar graph from the wild. Nick then rewrote the code to retrofit our data. 

Code Organisation/Cleanliness
- The main folder for our work is 'A4-Group-Project-'. For HTML, within this, there is a main index.html for the main page. Then each webpage has a separate folder (1) analysis (2) methodology and (3) about us. Each of these has a folder with a index html page in it. 
- For CSS, there is a folder called styles, and within it we have our css stylesheet. This is referred to across our HTML pages and for the DS visualisation. 
- For Javascript, there is a folder called scripts, and within it there are the javascript files for the D3 visualisation. 
- Finally, there is data folder, which contains the data files: https://github.com/jonhudgins/A4-Group-Project-/tree/master/data
 (1) orginal source data: https://github.com/jonhudgins/A4-Group-Project-/tree/master/data/original-csvs
 (2) transformation steps/python script: https://github.com/jonhudgins/A4-Group-Project-/tree/master/python
 (3) final data: https://github.com/jonhudgins/A4-Group-Project-/tree/master/data/cleaned-json_bar-charts 


Narrative Structure & Cohesiveness
- As far as possible, each of us tried to work on a separate branch and then merge to master. 
- We also used a stylesheet and class ID tags that were referenced across HTML pages for cohesiveness. 
- Finally, we used our slack channel to keep each other informed about updates we had made individually.
