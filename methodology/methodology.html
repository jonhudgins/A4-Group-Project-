		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		  <h3>Media Cloud Overview</h3> 

		<p>Our data source, <a href="https://explorer.mediacloud.org/#/home"> Media Cloud</a> is a joint project created by the MIT Center for Civic Media and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. The website allows users to search individual media sources or across media sources by grouping into collections. The media collections span over 100 countries and 1.4 billion media stories. Media Cloud crawls approximately 59,000 sources and 611,000 stories every day.</p>

		<h3>Queries</h3> 

		<h4>Keywords</h4>
		<p>Utilizing the datasets stored within Media Cloud, we used the following queries in our research:</p>

		  <li> All Stories </li>
		  <li> Stories with “socialist” OR “socialism” </li>
		  <li> Stories with “socialist” AND “democrat” within 15 words of one another </li>
		  <li> Stories with  “socialist” OR “socialism” AND “green new deal” </li>
		  <li> Stories with “socialist” OR “socialism” AND “squad” OR “aoc” OR “alexandria ocasio-cortez” OR “ilhan omar” OR “rashida tlaib” </li>
		  <li> Stories with “socialist” OR “socialism” AND “medicare for all” </li>

		<h4>Timeline</h4> 
		<p> All searches were for the duration of 2019. </p>

		<h4>Definitions of Progressive and Conservative Media </h4> 
		<p> We use media source filters provided by Media Cloud. Their categorization is based on “relative number of tweets of election story urls by Clinton vs. Trump retweeters.” This leads to five quintiles - Left, Center Left, Center, Center Right, Right. This is a categorization based not on the ownership of media, the content of the story, nor the inclination of journalists. The list of media sources in each of these categories can be found here, along with samples of the major sources within each category. </p>

		<div class="main-list">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://sources.mediacloud.org/#/collections/9360520">Left</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://sources.mediacloud.org/#/collections/9360521">Center Left</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://sources.mediacloud.org/#/collections/9360522">Center</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://sources.mediacloud.org/#/collections/9360523">Center Right</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://sources.mediacloud.org/#/collections/9360524">Right</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<p> For our research, we categorized “progressive media” as “left” and “center left” sources.  We categorized “conservative media” as “right” and “center right” sources.  We categorized “all media” as all five filters. </p>

		
		<h4>Country and Language Scope</h4>

		<p>This data is not restricted to the United States, nor is it limited to English language media. Media Cloud pulls from multiple countries and languages. More details can be found <a href="https://mediacloud.org/support#determining-right-sources">here.</a></p>

		<h4>Data Cleaning</h4>

		<p>As an extra check, we have normalised all the data we are using. We have used data for a period of one year. We have also provided samples of news stories from these different categories, to give the reader a sense of the tone of reporting. We also show how the trends that emerged from the searching of our selected keywords, is different from the general trend of the category (i.e. searching for socialism in left media has a different trend from left media total stories).</p>
			
	
			<h3>Process</h3>

			<h4>Objectives for users </h4>

			<p>For the purpose of building this website and analysis, we identified our primary end user persona to be a political media researcher interested in how the media reports on political ideologies. We worked towards one specific case for this persona, analysis of media coverage of the socialism in progressive and conservative sources. We hope this research is of interest to those working in this field.</p>

			<h4>Objectives for ourselves </h4>

			<p>We also worked to create user value for a second user persona: ourselves, as students.  We used this project to conduct a piece of original research using Media Cloud, and to display that research in a custom built website.  In particular, we focused on creating narrative visualizations.  We built the front end of this site in HTML, CSS, and JS.  We cleaned our data in Python.  And we followed a scrum process throughout the project.  In the spirit of open source movement, we have linked to our github code repositories and scrum board detailing each step of our process below.</p>

			<h3>Code</h3>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/jonhudgins/A4-Group-Project-">Here</a> is our github page!</p>

			<h4> About Us </h4>

			<p> We are students in Data and Programming for Policymakers, an introductory course on programming and data visualisation at the Harvard Kennedy School for January term 2020. This website was custom built, end to end, as a class project.</p>
