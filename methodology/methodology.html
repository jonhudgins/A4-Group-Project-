		<h2>How did we get here?</h2>
		<h3>Using Media Cloud</h3> 

		<p>Media Cloud <link: https://explorer.mediacloud.org/#/home> is a joint project created by the MIT Center for Civic Media and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. The website allows users to search individual media sources or across media sources by grouping into collections. The media collections span over 100 countries and 1.4 billion media stories. Media Cloud crawls approximately 59,000 sources and 611,000 stories every day.</p>
		<p>We will demonstrate one use case for Media Cloud and hopefully inspire others to utilize the website for their own unique research-related needs.</p>

		<h3>Data Source for Analysis</h3> 

		<p>Utilizing the datasets stored within Media Cloud, we searched the term “Socialism” in news media to see how often the word is used in conservative versus progressive news outlets. For the sample, we did this for the last quarter of 2019.</p> 

		<p>Within Media Cloud, we filtered for "Left," "Center-Left", "Center," "Center-Right", and "Right" per the already established Media Cloud definitions. "Progressive" is therefore filtered as  "Left" and "Center-Left," and Conservative is filtered as “Right” and “Center Right.”</p>

		<p>Using this search methodology, we obtained datasets in .csv format. This is what we have visualized.</p> 

		<h3>Definitions of Left and Right Media</h3>

		<p>We use the same criteria of categorizing media, as used by Media Cloud. Their categorization is based on the "relative number of tweets of election story URLs by Clinton vs. Trump retweeters." This leads to five quintiles - Left, Center-Left, Center, Center-Right, Right. As we understand, this is a categorization based not on the ownership of media, the content of the story, nor the inclination of journalists. It is based on the relevant tweets by users, or readers, who are categorized as Clinton vs. Trump retweeters. The long list of media sources in each of these categories can be found here, along with samples of the significant sources within each group.</p>

		<h3>Country and Language Scope</h3>

		<p>This data is not restricted to the United States, nor is it limited to English language media. Media Cloud pulls from multiple countries and languages. More details can be found <here>.</p>

			<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>

			<p>As an extra check, we have normalized all the data we are using. We have used data for one year. We have also provided samples of news stories from these different categories, to give the reader a sense of the tone of reporting. We also show how the trends that emerged from the searching of our selected keywords are different from the general trend of the category (i.e., searching for socialism in left media has a different trend from left media total stories).</p>

			<p> This website will demonstrate one use case for <a href="https://explorer.mediacloud.org/#/home">Media Cloud</a> and hopefully inspire others to utilize the website for their own unique research related needs.</p>
