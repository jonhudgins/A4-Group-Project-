		<h1>Analysing Media Trends Effectively</h1>

		<h2>By Nicholas Anway (MPP &#39;21), Jonathan Hudgins (MC-MPA &#39;20), Inayat Sabhikhi (MPA &#39;20)</h2>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>Media has always been an essential part of democracy - from being an integral part of the political system, to setting social norms. Through this website we aim to provide customised features for researchers and to the general public, to look up and understand media trends. We use the data put together by Media Cloud (described below). We have provided a sample analysis on the use of the term &#39;socialism&#39; by the right and left media. We also show a sample visualisation that can be done with this.</p>

		<h3>Who are we?</h3>
		<p>We&#39;re students in Data and Programming for Policymakers, an introductory course on programming and data visualisation at the Harvard Kennedy School. This is our project of finding a data set and developing a D3 visualization. We did this using GitHub and following the scrum method.</p>

		<h2>Media Cloud for Research</h2>
		<h3>Methodology</h3> 
		<p>Media Cloud is a joint project created by the MIT Center for Civic Media and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. The website allows users to search individual media sources or across media sources by grouping into collections. The media collections span over 100 countries and 1.4 billion media stories. Media Cloud crawls approximately 59,000 sources and 611,000 stories every day.<p>

		<p><a href="https://explorer.mediacloud.org/#/home">This website</a> will demonstrate one use case for Media Cloud and hopefully inspire others to utilize the website for their own unique research related needs.</p>
