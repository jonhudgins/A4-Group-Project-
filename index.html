			<h1>Analyzing Media Trends Effectively</h1>

			<h5>By Nicholas Anway (MPP &#39;21), Jonathan Hudgins (MC-MPA &#39;20), Inayat Sabhikhi (MPA &#39;20)</h5>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>Media has always been an essential part of democracy - from being an integral part of the political system to setting social norms. Through this website, we aim to provide customized features for researchers and to the general public, to look up and understand media trends. We use the data put together by Media Cloud (see Methodology). We have provided a sample analysis of the use of the term "socialism" by the right and left media. We also show some sample visualizations built from this. </p>

		<h3>Who are we?</h3>
		<p>We are students in Data and Programming for Policymakers, an introductory course on programming and data visualization at the Harvard Kennedy School for January term 2020. This is our project of finding a data set and developing a visualization.  </p>

		<h3>Objectives for users</h3>
		<p>We envision our primary users to be political media researchers interested in how the media reports on politics. We demonstrate one specific case of analysis, using the term "socialism." In the spirit of the open-source movement, we also show our source code on how this analysis was done. We hope this piece of research is of interest to those working in this field. We also hope it is of importance to those interested in doing similar analyses. Finally, we link to our GitHub repository and Scrum Board detailing each step of our process, providing a clear rubric for our professor to grade us.  </p>

		<h3>Objectives for ourselves</h3>
		<p>As students of this course, we want to use this project to do a piece of original research using Media Cloud. We started with several hypotheses that were confirmed or resoundingly denied. We've put this together on the analysis page. We also want to put together a neat webpage that can display this research. Finally, we want to show you how we've got here, so we have adopted complete transparency in our methodology, sources, and process of working as a team.  </p>
