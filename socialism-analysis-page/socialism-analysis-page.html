			<h2>Why is the coverage around ‘socialism’ important?</h2>

			<p>The term socialism has made a comeback in american political discourse, as a serious ideology, i.e. democratic socialism and as a spectre of fear of what should be avoided at all costs. These two remarks from the President of the United States, Donald Trump and one of the leading Presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders over the past year underscore its importance.</p> 

			<p>“Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.... Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country” - President Donald Trump,  February 2019.</p>  

			<p>“Today in the second decade of the 21st century, we must take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion. ..We must recognize that in the 21st century, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, economic rights are human rights. That is what I mean by democratic socialism” - Senator Bernie Sanders, June 2019.</p>

			<h3>#1 The Right Covers Socialism More Than The Left</h3> 

			<p>We started with the hypothesis that the right and left media would be reporting on socialism (and socialist) differentially. This draws directly from the contradictory remarks made about it from leading figures in the right and left. While the President calls it a source of alarm, Democratic presidential candidate terms it a matter of human rights. The first finding is that there is a clear difference in the reporting around socialism between right and left media. The right media reports significantly more on this topic than the left media.</p>

	<h3>#2 This trend is particularly pronounced on certain polarizing policy issues/people</h3>
	<h4>A)  Right Media correlates Socialism with Democrat</h4>
	<p>When we query the use of the word socialism (and socialist) within a 15 word proximity to the word ‘democrat’, we see a marked correlation between this trend, and the regular trend of just socialism. This would indicate that if a story in the right media around socialism is gaining traction, it is highly likely to have the word democrat in the same sentence or paragraph. This obviously has bearing for word association in the minds of the readers. Incidentally, the peak reporting on this subject is around the European Union elections from 23rd - 26th May 2019. While there is a pronounced trend, the quantum is low (around 50 stories).</p>
