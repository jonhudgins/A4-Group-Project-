		<h3>Insights</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li> For the last quarter of 2019, i.e. October to December 2019, the use of &#39;socialism&#39; in left and right media is fairly substantial. Its use varies significantly, with spike in certain periods, such as mid November and mid December.</li>
				<li> Its use by the right media mirrors the overall trend, i.e. it is largely the frequency and timing of its use in the right media that determines the overall trend.</li>
				<li>Its use in the left media is both significantly less than the right, and has some differentials in pattern from the right and overall media. </li>
			</ul>

		<h3>How did we get here?</h3>
		<p>Utilizing the datasets stored within Media Cloud, we searched the term &#39;Socialism&#39; to see how often the word is used in conservative versus progressive news outlets. For the sample, we did this for the last quarter of 2019.</p>
		<p>Within Media Cloud, we  filtered for &#39;Left&#39;, &#39;Center Left&#39;, &#39;Center&#39;, &#39;Center Right&#39;, and &#39;Right&#39; per the already established Media Cloud definitions. &#39;Progressive&#39; is therefore filtered as  &#39;Left&#39; and &#39;Center Left&#39; and Conservative is filtered as &#39;Right&#39; and &#39;Center Right.&#39;</p>
		<p>Using this search methodology, we obtained datasets in .csv format.</p>
